# -python2-3-PIP2-3-
solve the issue of using pip2/3 and python2/3 on same windows 64

Download python2.7 installer, add /python27 and python27/script to environment, copy python.exe in /python27, and paste it in same /python27, than rename it as python2.exe.

Problem fixed.

Run python2 in cmd, and pip2 in cmd. If not working, check path environment.

复制一份python,exe，重命名为python2即可。 记得加环境变量
